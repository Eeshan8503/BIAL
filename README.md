## Problems Passengers Run Into At Airports.

1. **TROUBLE WITH BAGGAGE**: Lost baggage is a common complaint people have at airport. There is a lot of pressure on the current, outdated baggage handling system, which is why airports need to start looking into more modern baggage solutions.

2. **DIFFICULTY IN NAVIGATION**: The main, obvious problem that can happen in the larger airports is that it's far too easy to get lost. Some airports have multiple terminals, with gates spanning in every direction, and finding your gate can often seem like a daunting task for those who are directionally challenged.

3. **FIRST TIME PASSENGERS**: India is a developing nation, there will come new passengers every day who are unaware of airport check-in process. Its responsibility of the airport to help them out.

4. **FLIGHT DELAYS AND CANCELLATION**: Passengers complaing that they aren’t kept informed of flight cancellation and delays. There’s nothing more frustrating for a passenger, than turning up early and waiting around for hours, only to discover at the last minute there’s been a delay or change in the flight schedule.

5. **CUSTOMER SERVICE**: Although it’s difficult for airports to build up a personal relationship with passengers, providing exceptional customer service should always be a priority. Good costumer service keeps passenger demands/needs in check.

## App Objective
The objective of this App is to provide solutions to the common problems faced at airports.
- A QR code will be generated for every passenger who enters the airport. This QR code will have his general information providing an extra level of security, later this code can be scanned at all checkpoints to help build a better navigation system and inform the airline staff were the passengers are ie. number of passengers who have checked-in or are late are stuck in the security line. The QR code will also have some private meta-data which will be hidden and only the API could cypher it, the details are provided in the implementation section. 
- Navigation System and checkpoints to make app interactive and help people in the check-in process.
- Help Desk to ask for help whenever required.
- Report unknown baggage and security threats.
- RESTful API with nodejs and Express for passengers as well as staff.

## App Implementation
- React Native framework to natively-render the application for both iOS and Android.
- JSON Web Tokens to generate secure QR codes to physically authenticate luggage and and their owners.
- Generate QR codes for every individual Baggage which can be scanned by any passenger or airport authority showing the information regarding to whom it belongs to
- This QR will also help the relavant authorities find the passenger and the passenge looking for his bag and in a few minute the passenger can be uniquely identified the realvant processes can be executed with more ease and less effort 

### Using azure services

- The User database can be stored in the azure cosmos database
- The app can be hosted on azure
- Relavant machine learning and artificial intelegence can later be implimented helping the passengers even more
