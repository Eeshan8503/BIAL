## Problems Passengers Run Into At Airports.

1. **TROUBLE WITH BAGGAGE**: Lost baggage is a common complaint people have at airport. There is a lot of pressure on the current, outdated baggage handling system, which is why airports need to start looking into more modern baggage solutions.

2. **DIFFICULTY IN NAVIGATION**: The main, obvious problem that can happen in the larger airports is that it's far too easy to get lost. Some airports have multiple terminals, with gates spanning in every direction, and finding your gate can often seem like a daunting task for those who are directionally challenged.

3. **FIRST TIME PASSENGERS**: India is a developing nation, there will come new passengers every day who are unaware of airport check-in process. Its responsibility of the airport to help them out.

4. **FLIGHT DELAYS AND CANCELLATION**: Passengers complaing that they aren’t kept informed of flight cancellation and delays. There’s nothing more frustrating for a passenger, than turning up early and waiting around for hours, only to discover at the last minute there’s been a delay or change in the flight schedule.

5. **CUSTOMER SERVICE**: Although it’s difficult for airports to build up a personal relationship with passengers, providing exceptional customer service should always be a priority. Good costumer service keeps passenger demands/needs in check.
